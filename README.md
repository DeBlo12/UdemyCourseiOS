This is me following Angela Yu's London App Brewery Course. 

I have done parts of it a while back. However, I wanted to explore other possible ways of programming, so I stopped iOS programming, partially also because I switched to Android in my private life, due to monetary contraints. However, I prefer Swift over C# and other programming languages. 

Next to this, I will be following LAB's Python / ML course.
